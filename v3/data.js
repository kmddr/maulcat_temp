    "description": "The debut EP of vertical slopes consists of six brief tape loops, described by mostly ambient soundscapes. What was just a one-off side project of rybbon became an entire separate alias from the artist, evolving into a new genre under his belt. Also composed of the occasional drum patterns, the release varies without becoming monotonous, as most tracks stay short and sweet.<br><br>On then night of July 2nd, this became the second release under Maulcat Records."
